                    Sam hasn't returned to her hometown Tuerpriest since she moved away.  She was only six at the

                    alike flood back, Sam becomes aware that the strangeness of Tuerpriest has a sinister edge, 
                    and it's searching for her.<br><br>  Moonsick monsters, paranormal mysteries and twisted 
                    history; the woods surrounding Tuerpriest are full of secrets for Sam to uncover.

                    Sam has lots of hazy, warm memories of her childhood in Tuerpriest.  She remembers, 
                    flowering fields and bright forest; main street decorated in Christmas lights.  What
                    she can't remember is anything from the year she turned six.<br><br>
                    Sam is bright, eager and a little timid in the face of her new old hometown.  Haunted 
                    by urgent nightmares that have scraped the back of her mind for a decade, Sam will need 
                    more than a little bravery, and help, to discover the secret behind what it is she has 
                    worked so hard to forget.<br><br>
                    The more Sam learns, the more she suspects that the very same forces that drove her off
                    are responsible for calling her back once more.

                    Cyrus has two secrets.  The first: he knows that the rumors of monstrous creatures
                    prowling through darkened woods are true, and he knows exactly what the beasts are.
                    The second: he's one of them. <br><br>  
                    When Cyrus reunites with Sam for the first time since the first grade, he quickly 
                    realizes it's more than a coincidence that's brought her back to town. Something has 
                    called her back to Tuerpriest.  The lives of Sam and Cyrus fast become inextricably 
                    entangled as they work to discover who or what it is that seeks them.<br><br>
                    Cyrus is determined to defend Tuerpriest and Sam alike from what calls to her in 
                    the woods.

                   June hasn't found it easy to make friends since her father left.  So, when Sam moves
                   back to Tuerpriest, June is thrilled to suddenly have not just one new friend, but two.
                   June would do anything for Sam and Cyrus, and she knows that they'd do anything for
                   her, too.<br><br>
                   But Sam is followed by nightmares she can't bring herself to share, and Cyrus is so full
                   of secrets that he could burst at any minute.  It doesn't take June long to realize there 
                   is more to her friends-and more to her hometown-then she'd ever realized.<br><br>
                   June is warm, compassionate and brave, but nothing can have prepared her for revelations 
                   her nearly supernatural empathy will bring.
