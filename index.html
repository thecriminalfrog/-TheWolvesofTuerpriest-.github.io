                    The vision for 'The Wolves of Tuerpriest was born in December of 2019.  However, it wasn't 
                    until almost a year later in 2020 that it became more than a premise for art and intensive
                    storyboarding began.  <br><br>Our goal is to bring you to best story, characters and art 
                    that we possibly can, and that takes some time.<br><br>
